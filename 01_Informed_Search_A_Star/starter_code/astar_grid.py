Assignment starter: A* search on a grid.

Your job: fill in every function marked TODO. Do not change function
signatures (the tests in test_astar_grid.py rely on them).

    Follow the pseudocode in ../guide.md section 4:
      1. Use a heapq-based priority queue keyed on f(n) = g(n) + h(n).
      2. Track g_score for every discovered node.
      3. Track came_from so you can reconstruct the path.
      4. Track a closed set of fully-expanded nodes.
      5. Stop as soon as you POP the goal node from the open list
         (not merely when you first see it as a neighbour).

    Tie-break tip: pushing tuples like (f, -g, row, col, node) onto the
    heap gives you a deterministic tie-break (prefer larger g) -- see the
    worked example solution for this pattern if you get stuck.
